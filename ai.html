                <h1 class="heading">What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>
                <p id="para">In today's world, technology is growing very fast, and we are getting in touch with different new technologies day by day. <br>

                    Here, one of the booming technologies of computer science is Artificial Intelligence which is ready to create a new revolution in the world by making intelligent machines.The Artificial Intelligence is now all around us. It is currently working with a variety of subfields, ranging from general to specific, such as self-driving cars, playing chess, proving theorems, playing music, Painting, etc.</p>

               <div class="video">
                <video controls src="aivideo.mp4" id="video"></video>
               </div>

               <p id="para">AI is one of the fascinating and universal fields of Computer science which has a great scope in future. AI holds a tendency to cause a machine to work as a human.
                Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking power."</p>
                <br>
                <p id="para">So, we can define AI as:</p>
                <p id="imp-points"> "It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions."</p>

                <br>

                <p id="para">Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human based skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems

                    With Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with own intelligence, and that is the awesomeness of AI.
                    
                    It is believed that AI is not a new technology, and some people says that as per Greek myth, there were Mechanical men in early days which can work and behave like humans.</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">Goals of Artificial Intelligence</h1>    

                    <p id="para">Following are the main goals of Artificial Intelligence: <br>

                       1. Replicate human intelligence <br>
                        2. Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks <br>
                        3. An intelligent connection of perception and action <br>
                        4. Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as: <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->Proving a theorem <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->Playing chess <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->Plan some surgical operation <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->Driving a car in traffic <br>
                       5.  Creating some system which can exhibit intelligent behavior, learn new things by itself, demonstrate, explain, and can advise to its user.</p>

                      <br>
                       <h1 class="heading"> What Comprises to Artificial Intelligence?</h1> 

                       <p id="para">Artificial Intelligence is not just a part of computer science even it's so vast and requires lots of other factors which can contribute to it. To create the AI first we should know that how intelligence is composed, so the Intelligence is an intangible part of our brain which is a combination of Reasoning, learning, problem-solving perception, language understanding, etc.</p>
                       <p id="para">To achieve the above factors for a machine or software Artificial Intelligence requires the following discipline:  <br>

                      <h1 class="heading">Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
                      <p id="para">Every technology has some disadvantages, and thesame goes for Artificial intelligence. Being so advantageous technology still, it has some disadvantages which we need to keep in our mind while creating an AI system. Following are the disadvantages of AI:</p>
                      <p id="para"><b>High Cost:</b><br> The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of maintenance to meet current world requirements.</p>
                      <p id="para"><b>Can't think out of the box:</b><br> Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained, or programmed.</p>
                      <p id="para"><b>No feelings and emotions:</b> <br>AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with human, and may sometime be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken.</p>
                      <p id="para"><b>No Original Creativity:</b><br> As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.</p>
